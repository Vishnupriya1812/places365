When we talk about the Pre-trained model in the Computer Vision domain, Alexnet comes out as a leading architecture.
We have tried to use layers similar to the AlexNET to meet our problem i.e. to classify scenarios. To accelerate the process we have used the TPUs. The reports of the model have been displayed using weights and biases.
Key points:
-	Used TPUs to accelerate the alexnet model training due to usage of large number of data.
-	Report generation using Weights and Biases - Weights & Biases is the machine learning platform for developers to build better models faster. Use W&B's lightweight, interoperable tools to quickly track experiments, version and iterate on datasets, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results and spot regressions, and share findings with colleagues.
